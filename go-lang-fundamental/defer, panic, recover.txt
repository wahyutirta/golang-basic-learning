Defer
- used to delay execution of a statement until function exits with
- useful to group "open" and "close" function together (beware loop)
- run in LIFO order (last in, first out) 
- arguments evaluated at time defer is executed, not at time of the called function execution
Panic
- Occur when program cannot continue at all
    - dont use when a file cant be opened, unless it is critical
    - use for uncoverable events - cannot obtain TCP port for web server
- Function will stop executing
    - Deferred funtion will still fire
- if nothing handle panic, program will exit
Recover
- used to recover from panic
- only useful in deferred funtions
- current function will not attempt to continue, but higher function in call stack will
